Linux-RTC-Ioctl

v0.8

Provides access to the Linux RTC driver (Real Time Clock), using one of
the RTC device files in a Linux system:
    - /dev/rtc
    - /dev/rtc0
    - /dev/rtc1
    - ...

Note /dev/rtc is now usually a symlink to /dev/rtc0

Beware the RTC should not be used directly for usual timer or date and
time services, but rather it is a low level hardware device that is
mostly managed by the OS.

The main feature you might be interested in is the wake-up alarm, that
on most hardware can pull the computer out of suspend / stand-by mode or
even out of shut down (power-on by alarm clock).

The RTC runs in a time zone that is independent of the system time zone.
So the time zone can be either GMT or the local time zone, and most
Linux distributions install with GMT by default, to prevent problems
with the transition to and from daylight saving time (DST or summer
time).

Functionality from this module is based on access to the system device
files (/dev/rtc, /dev/rtcN), and so are expected to require root privileges.

Module is written according to the available driver documentation for
the RTC Linux kernel driver, found at
    https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/rtc.txt

Uses the ioctl interface (instead of sysfs interface).

Linux::RTC::Ioctl is an extension module that require a C compiler and
the <linux/rtc.h> system header for installation.
